=begin take each individual digit, square it, and then sum the squares to get 
a new number. Repeat with the new number and eventually, you might get 
to a number whose squared sum is 1. This is a happy number. An unhappy 
number (or sad number) is one that loops endlessly. Write a function 
that determines if a number is happy or not.
